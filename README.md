# Swiggy-AOV-
THE CHALLENGE IS?

Swiggy’s quick commerce grocery business Instamart has been used by 9 million customers and has expanded to over 25 cities in the two years since it began operations in 2022. According to Karthik Gurumurthy, Head of Instamart, the quick commerce business can be made sustainable through three levers - right order value, the right density of stores, and monetisation through ads.

You’ve been hired as the Senior Vice President, Product at Swiggy Instamart.

Blinkit's average order value (AOV) is among the highest in the industry at approximately ₹607, while Swiggy Instamart's AOV is around ₹420. To compete with Blinkit and Zepto in the quick commerce sector and boost your AOV, thereby enhancing your top line, you need to strategically target the right user segments. Develop and implement product features on your existing platform aimed at increasing AOV and reaching around ₹550 by the end of 2024.

You have to come up with a detailed plan covering: -

Product features/Improved features to be rolled out in the current app
Prioritisation of the features suggested
Market sizing/business opportunity/Monetization strategy, if any.
